[Verse 1]
Babe, our love is alive
We could raise our voices at night (Hmm)
Blissful we are every time (Every time)
You put your heart into mine
We could share a cup of coffee
While we chillin' on my porch, babe
Come and wrap your arms around me
Then I could take you to the floor
You could always make me your blanket baby
But don't cover your face, ain't no room for insеcurities

[Verse 2]
No, I won't pedal back, lose track
Even though I get heart attacks
Every time you wet your lips
Babe, you're impeccable, a sensual perfect individual
Turn around, sure I won't miss
